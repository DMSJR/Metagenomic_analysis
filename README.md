# Mapping bacterial sialic acid metabolism pathways in sequencing data of inflammatory bowel diseases and _Clostridioides difficile_ infection.
This project aims to reprocess and reanalyse public data from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and _Clostridioides difficile_ infection (CDI), searching for associations between those diseases and microbial genes related to sialic acid (Sia) in the gut microbiota.
